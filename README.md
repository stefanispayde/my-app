This is my first web app I created using React.js. It is a simple game of tic-tac-toe, however I implemented "Time Travel" which tracks the history of each move on the board, and assigns a unique ID to each one in sequential order. When you click on any step in the game's history (each step is provided a button), the game board is updated to show what it looked like at the time that step was made. A message appears to show whether "X" or "O" has won the game.

languages/frameworks/libraries used: React.js, Javascript, CSS3, create-react-app, language-babel, npm
